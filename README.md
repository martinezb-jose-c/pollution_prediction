# Air Quality Prediction

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict air quality for a given day by comparing two Machine Learning models: **Decision Trees** and **Multiple Linear Regression**.

To achieve this, the project follows these steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the dataset  
   - Visualizing patterns  
   - Preprocessing the data  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Implementing and training both Decision Trees and Multiple Linear Regression models  

3. **Evaluation and Analysis**  
   - Comparing the performance of both models using appropriate metrics  
   - Analyzing the results  

By the end of the project, we aim to determine which model provides the most accurate air quality predictions.
